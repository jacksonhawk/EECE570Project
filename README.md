# EECE570Project
The three .ipynb files contain all the code run to produce results

TestingOnCoco are the tests done on pretrained weights 
TestingOnVoc are the results on the trained weights
trainingTestingBuiltInScripts contain the training to produce the weights needed for TestingOnVoc and also contain speed tests

Running the code blocks in the notebook files will download necessary files from either internet, or this github directory
- note not all output logs in the downloaded file are accurate representations, as multiple files, accounts, and computers were used to get around Google Colab GPU usage limits

The trained weights were unable to be included on GitHub, so they are attached in the submission folder
